# Prometheus Parquet Working Group

This repository is for the work of the Prometheus Parquet Working Group, focused on exploring and researching the use of Apache Parquet together with Prometheus for efficient metrics storage and querying.

## Overview

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. This working group explores ways to leverage Parquet's capabilities for storing Prometheus metrics data, potentially offering:

- Improved long-term storage efficiency
- Better query performance for historical data
- Easier integration with data processing tools that support Parquet
- Reduced storage costs

## Goals

- Define standardized schemas for storing Prometheus metrics in Parquet format
- Develop reference implementations for Prometheus to Parquet conversion
- Create tools for querying Parquet-stored metrics data
- Establish best practices for Parquet-based Prometheus metric archival
- Explore integration with existing Prometheus ecosystem tools

## Getting Involved

As a new working group, we welcome contributions and participation from the community! Here are ways to get involved:

- Join our CNCF slack channel [prometheus-parquet-dev](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08GK56D2H1)
- Participate on issues and pull requests.
- Contribute code, documentation, or testing
- Provide feedback on proposed designs and implementations
